As part of a University Coursework, i was required to Design a Protocol that allowed two users to communicate with each other in a closed environment. 
After completeing this assignment i decided to take this project one step further and develop a Full Messaging Program.
The program and protocol i created (combined with server code obtained from David Thorne), allows two users to communicate provided they are connected to the same web server.

Currently the program is able to work on two seperate devices, provided that these devices are connected to the University Wifi.
The program also works on seperate terinals that are connected to the same Localhost servers.

I am in the process of expanding this program to be able to use an online web server, and not rely on a localhost or University Server.
